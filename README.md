M7011E - CodeBasics
 
Idea is in simplicity that system would be a video database 
(youtube-videos, links to other videos, own videos, etc.) 
where users can watch basic programming videos and by that 
way learn programming. The videos would be categorized by 
language, they would also have a kind of level (1-10 for example), 
some describing tags, and number of likes/dislikes. Users can 
watch videos and may also ask some questions related to specific 
video if they do not understand something. I will also add some 
gamification elements as, for example, level of proficiency. 
That level would go up at least in order to how many videos you 
have watched. Users can also recommend videos to be added on the 
system. This recommendation list is then handled by administrators.
